# World_Weather_Analysis

# Note:

When completing this challenge my API calls would timeout very often. I did my best to save the results (when they finally arrived) to csv, but had to limit the amount of rows in my call. Additionally, I was trying to avoid making the call so in "Vacation_Search.ipynb" I needed to begin other deliverables by reading the csv instead of calling the API again. I apologize for any confusion, and I am very eager to learn the resolution. As a result of this barrier, "WeatherPy_Vacation_map.png" in the "Vacation_Itinerary" folder does not have a route, because I could not yield enough cities from my limited API call (it would not complete the call if I requested more than 15 rows of data). The .png file does not display a route because having fewer random cities, results in more space between these cities, to which "DRIVING" is not available for travel accross continents. I hope this clears things up, thank you!
