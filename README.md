# World_Weather_Analysis

# Note:

At first, my API calls would timeout every time - they stopped timing out when I decreased the rows of the table. I did my best to save the results (when they finally arrived) to csv, but had to limit the amount of rows in my call. Additionally, (I was trying to avoid making the call) in "Vacation_Search.ipynb" I needed to begin other deliverables by reading the csv instead of calling the API again. I apologize for any confusion, and I am very eager to learn the resolution to this obstacle. As a result of this barrier, "WeatherPy_Vacation_map.png" in the "Vacation_Itinerary" folder does not have a route, because I could not yield enough cities from my limited API call (it would not complete the call if I requested more than 15 rows of data). The .png file does not display a route because having fewer random cities, results in more space between these cities, to which "DRIVING" is not available for travel accross continents. I hope this clears things up, thank you!
